		<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>We need to get our JavaScript file work correctly.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Working with our partner, experiment with JS events. It was difficult to change the existing function to meet the requirements of this lab.
		Using the event listener was a new task that we learned to integrate into this lab. In addition to that, it was hard to ensure that the outcome of the JavaScript
	file would output correctly. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here is our program execution:</p>
		<div id="output">
			<h3>Script Output</h3>
			<p><label>Input your name:<br>
			<input type="input" id="user-name"></label>
	    <button id="my-button">Submit</button></p>
			<button onclick="tryAgain()">Try again</button>
		</div>
