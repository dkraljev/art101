		<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<p>This lab was meant to create a local file structure on my computer as well as add an index.html file.</p>
		<h2>Some Challenges</h2>
		<p>Creating the file was straight forward and simple to successfully do! Any difficulties I
			were based off of my lack of knowledge of html syntax and tags </p>
		<h2>Results of Lab 3</h2>
		<p>The file was created and i was able to create the html code successfully within the document! Here is the Image of the file structure! </p>
